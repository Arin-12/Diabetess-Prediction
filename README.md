# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction App

A **Machine Learning web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not.  
The app provides predictions using **two models â€“ Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)** â€“ and also gives **risk probabilities** along with **medical interpretations** of each input factor.

## âœ¨ Key Highlights
- ðŸ§  **Dual Model Prediction:** Compare results from **SVM** and **Random Forest**.  
- ðŸ“Š **Risk Probability:** Shows the confidence of each prediction.  
- ðŸ©º **Medical Risk Analysis:** Explains what each parameter means (Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, etc.).  
- âš¡ **Interactive Streamlit Interface:** Easy-to-use sidebar inputs.  
- ðŸ“‚ **Reusable Codebase:** Models and scaler saved with `pickle` for deployment.
